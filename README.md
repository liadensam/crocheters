# crocheters
Project 1
This is the first group project. First of all This project is about “testing the water”. Everyone will be trying many things for the first time in this course, like organizing a team of people who are new to each other, creating a UI, coding it, deploying it and presenting the work to industry professionals, all that while taking part in a community to get and give support whenever needed.
Our group decided on designing a website for a product. We wanted our project to be realistic and have a real client, it also made the project more fun and was something we could see being presented to us in the real world. We reached out to Lóa‘s sister and made her our client and decided on making her a Portfolio. She is selling her crochet designes on Instagram. We wanted to represent her Instragram image and went for a soft and vintage look. We used our networking and had a graphic designer create a Logo for our page. We felt it was an imporant touch for our final product.
We are very satisfied with our final design and gained a lot from this group work.
